{"name":"Redis Locker","tagline":"Destroys the concurrency of your ruby code using Redis.","body":"# redis-locker\r\n\r\nA super-FAST and super-ROBUST LOCKING mechanism.\r\nBuilds queue of concurrent code blocks using Redis.\r\n\r\nIf Redis fails at some point (cleared, filled with wrong data, stuck) it will be trying to stay alive anyway. This is supported by additional key-control.\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n```\r\n$ gem install redis-locker\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr put in your gemfile for latest version:\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'redis-locker', git: 'git://github.com/einzige/redis-locker.git'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Using\r\n```ruby\r\n# Throws an error if transaction will not be finished in 10 seconds\r\nRedisLocker.new('payment_transaction').run!(10.seconds) do\r\n  # Any concurrent code.\r\nend\r\n\r\n# Throws an error if transaction will not be finished in 10 seconds\r\n# Clears all stale tasks which were not performed within 10 seconds\r\nRedisLocker.new('payment_transaction', 10.seconds).run! do\r\n  # Any concurrent code.\r\nend\r\n\r\n# Does not throw any error, but clears all stale tasks which were not performed within 10 seconds\r\nRedisLocker.new('payment_transaction', 10.seconds).run do\r\n  # Any concurrent code.\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Running specs\r\n- Clone the repo\r\n- run `bundle exec rake spec`\r\n\r\n## Contributing to redis-locker\r\n\r\n- Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet\r\n- Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it\r\n- Fork the project\r\n- Start a feature/bugfix branch\r\n- Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution\r\n- Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.\r\n- Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.\r\n\r\n## Copyright\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013 Sergei Zinin.
